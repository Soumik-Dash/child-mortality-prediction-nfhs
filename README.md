# Predicting Child Mortality in India: A Study Based on NFHS Data

This repository contains the complete implementation of a machine learning project that predicts child mortality outcomes using socio-demographic and health-related data from the **National Family Health Survey (NFHS)**. The project applies a range of classification models and interprets the results using explainable AI techniques.

---

## üéØ Objective

The goal of this project is to classify whether a child will survive or not based on variables such as:
- Maternal age
- Total children ever born
- Birth order
- Education level
- Wealth index
- Place of residence
- Religion, caste, and contraceptive method
- Marital status, and more

This analysis aims to inform policy and healthcare interventions by identifying key determinants of child mortality in India.

## üìä Dataset

- **Source**: [National Family Health Survey (NFHS)](https://dhsprogram.com)
- **Description**: A nationally representative survey collecting population, health, and nutrition indicators in India.
- **Target Variable**: Binary classification ‚Äî `1` for death, `0` for alive.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Due to data privacy policies, raw data is not uploaded. Only a cleaned and anonymized version is used for modeling.

## üß™ Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Missing value imputation
  - Label Encoding (ordinal features) and One-Hot Encoding (nominal features)
  - Feature scaling using Standardization
  - SMOTE for handling class imbalance

- **Models Implemented**
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier
  - XGBoost Classifier

- **Evaluation Metrics**
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
  - ROC-AUC
  - Confusion Matrix

- **Model Interpretation**
  - Feature Importance from Tree Models
  - SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) for local and global interpretability
